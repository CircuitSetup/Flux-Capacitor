# Hardware tips

CircuitSetup provides the [electronics](https://circuitsetup.us/product/flux-capacitor-light-sound-pcb), a [window kit](https://circuitsetup.us/product/flux-capacitor-window-kit) and the [back board](https://circuitsetup.us/product/flux-capacitor-backing-board). Here is some information on the other parts you'll need.

## Box

The box is a [Stahlin J1210HPL](https://stahlin.com/product/j-series-12-x-10-x-5-inches-j1210hpl-enclosure/), still available. The color does not match the movies, but it can be spray-painted; a suitable color would be Pantone 423C.

CircuitSetup's kits come with templates for holes and the door window.

For replicating exactly what is seen in the movies, the door latches need to moved inward by one inch:

Since the SD card on the control board is inaccessible after assembling the FC (but required to install the audio files, and possibly used for music files), I used an SD extension (like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Electop-Extension-Extender-Compatible-Raspberry/dp/B07SYFCG17/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=sd+extension&qid=1706513216&sr=8-4)), and mounted the slot through a hole in the bottom of my FC so that the SD card can be accessed at any time.

### Warning

This box is made from molded fiberglass reinforced polyester. This is a highly dangerous material, so wear a proper mask when drilling, sawing or sanding.

## Torr relays

The CircuitSetup back board is made to fit the [Radbench](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5164173) Torr relay replicas and accessories, such as cable boots, L-brackets and acrylic "light-bars".

Since I try to avoid 3D-printed parts as much as possible, I went for replicas made from brass made by user [stuff565](https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/stuff565) on ebay (he is a well known member of the Delorean Time Machine scene). Suitable boots for the ignition cables are available from [maxthemad](https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/maxthemad).

If you go this route, you need to enlarge the holes in CircuitSetup's back board to fit the tubes, and due to their weight, the relays need to be screwed on the back board. The resin inside the relay replicas is fine for screws, a bit of pre-drilling is recommended.

Also, for the brass replicas, 
- the L-bracket and the cable boots needs to be larger, and
- the light bars need to be a bit taller.

Suitable STL-files matching the brass-replicas for brackets, boots and light bars are in this repository. (The boots are an alternative to maxthemad's, and need some trimming to fit; I preferred this way because my boots better resemble the ones shown in the movies.)

The yellow cables are simply yellow 7mm ignition cables, easy to find. The boots are painted in RAL2008, although I don't know if this is authentic. I used the O-rings (same color as boots) from [Radbench](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5164173)'s collection of parts.

## Light bars

Radbench and others usually paint the light bars with "mirror silver" before coating them in black. I had no luck with this since it caused cracks in the acrylic. So I skipped this step and only painted the outsides black (using a _water-based_ color). IMHO the mirror paint is pointless, since the light is reflected by the surface of the acrylic glass anyway. As a final step I slightly sanded the unpainted top surfaces so that the single LEDs aren't clearly visible in the end.

## External stuff

Elbows: These are aviation plugs going by MS3108B, dimensions 20-29 and 32. In the original, these were made by Cannon (ITT), but those are no longer available. JAE is a suitable replacement, and those offered by Chinese vendors on ebay also match closely. 

Big pipe on top: Genova 30720 (2")

The black pipe on the left and the hose on the right are fully custom made; the hose is enclosed in parts used in compressed air equipment.
